--- abstract

This document extends the use of DNS NOTIFY ({{!RFC1996}} beyond conventional
zone transfer hints, bringing the benefits of ad-hoc notifications to DNS
delegation maintenance in general.  Use cases include DNSSEC key rollovers
hints, and quicker changes to a delegation's NS record set.

To enable this functionality, a method for discovering the receiver endpoint
for such notification message is introduced, via the new NOTIFY record type.

TO BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated on in Github at:
[https://github.com/peterthomassen/draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify](https://github.com/peterthomassen/draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify).
The most recent working version of the document, open issues, etc. should all be
available there.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.

# Introduction

Traditional DNS notifications {{!RFC1996}}, which are here referred to as
"NOTIFY(SOA)", are sent from a primary server to a secondary server to
minimize the latter's convergence time to a new version of the
zone. This mechanism successfully addresses a significant inefficiency
in the original protocol.

Today similar inefficiencies occur in new use cases, in particular delegation
maintenance (DS and NS record updates). Just as in the NOTIFY(SOA) case, a new
set of notification types will have a major positive benefit by
allowing the DNS infrastructure to completely sidestep these
inefficiencies. For additional context, see {{context}}.

No DNS protocol changes are introduced by this document. The mechanism
instead makes use of a wider range of DNS messages allowed by the protocol.
Future extension for further use cases (such as multi-signer key exchange)
is possible.

Readers are expected to be familiar with DNSSEC, including {{!RFC4033}},
{{!RFC4034}}, {{!RFC4035}}, {{!RFC6781}}, {{!RFC7344}}, {{!RFC7477}},
{{!RFC7583}}, and {{!RFC8901}}.

## Requirements Notation

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL
NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**NOT
RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only
when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Terminology

In the text below there are two different uses of the term
"NOTIFY". One refers to the NOTIFY message, sent from a DNSSEC signer
or name server to a notification target (for subsequent
processing). We refer to this message as NOTIFY(RRtype) where the
RRtype indicates the type of NOTIFY message (CDS or CSYNC).

The second is a proposed new DNS record type, with the suggested
mnemonic "NOTIFY". This record is used to publish the location of the
notification target. We refer to this as the "NOTIFY record".

# Publication of Notification Targets

To use generalized notifications, it is necessary for the sender to know
where to direct each NOTIFY message. This section describes the
procedure for discovering that notification target.

Note that generalized NOTIFY messages are but one mechanism for
improving the efficiency of automated delegation maintenance. Other
alternatives alternatives, such as contacting the parent via an API or
DNS Update ({{!RFC2136}}), may (or may not) be more suitable in
individual cases. Like generalized notifications, they similarly require
a means for discovering where to send the API or DNS Update requets.

The scope for the publication mechanism is therefore wider than only to
support generalized notifications, and a unified approach that works
independently of the notification method is specified in this section.

## Design Requirements

When the parent is interested in notifications for delegation
maintenance (such as for DS or NS updates), a service will need to be
made available for accepting these notifications. Depending on the
context, this service may be run by the parent zone operator themselves,
or by a designated entity who is in charge of handling the domain's
delegation data (such as a domain registrar).

The simplest solution enabling straightforward discovery is for the
parent to publish the address where it prefers to have notifications
sent. Potential notification senders, knowing the name of the parent
zone, can then simply look up that information.

It is strongly desirable that the notification sender is able to figure
out where to send the NOTIFY via a single lookup, even when ignorant of
the details of the parent-side business relationships (e.g., whether
there is a registrar or not). The mechanism should thus enable the parent to
(optionally) announce the notification endpoint in a delegation-specific
way. (If the delegation is several labels deep, an extra query may be
needed for identifying the parent.)

These requirements suggest making the endpoint discoverable at a
child-specific name. The record there is expected to live at a wildcard
name, unless the parent intends to publish a child-specific endpoint.

## Signaling Method

Parents participating in the discovery scheme for the purpose of
delegation maintenance notifications MUST publish endpoint information
using the record type defined in {{dsyncrdtype}}, as described in this
section.

The suggested mnemonic for the new record type is "DSYNC" and it is
further described below.

If the parent itself performs CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC processing, or if
the parent forwards the notifications internally to the designated party
(such as as registrar), the following scheme is used:

    *._signal.se.   IN DSYNC  CDS   scheme port endpoint.registry.se.
    *._signal.se.   IN DSYNC  CSYNC scheme port endpoint.registry.se.

It is also possible to publish child-specific records, where the
wildcard label is replaced by the child's FQDN with the parent zone's
labels stripped.

As an example, consider a registrar offering domains like `example.se`,
delegated from `se` zone. If the registrar provides the notification
endpoint, the parent may publish this information using the following
scheme:

    example._signal.se.   IN DSYNC  CDS   scheme port endpoint.registrar.com.

(Note that this is a generic method, allowing the parent to securely
publish other sorts of information about a child that currently is not
easily represented in DNS, such as the registrar's identity.)

The parent MAY synthesize records under the `_signal` domain. The
`_signal` domain may be delegated to another nameserver dedicated for
this purpose.

To accommodate indirect delegation management models (such as ICANN's
RRR model), the parent's designated notification target may relay
notifications to the registrar, e.g. via an EPP call, or by forwarding
the NOTIFY(CDS) message directly. The same is true also for
NOTIFY(CSYNC).


# The DSYNC Record {#dsyncrdtype}

## Wire Format

The DSYNC RDATA wire format is encoded as follows:

                         1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | RRtype                        | Scheme        | Port
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                    | Target ...  /
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-/

RRtype
: The type of generalized NOTIFY that this DSYNC RR defines the
desired target address for. For now, only CDS and CSYNC are
supported values.

Scheme
: The scheme for locating the desired notification address.  The range
is 0-255. This is an 8 bit unsigned integer. The value 0 is an error,
and values 128-255 are reserved for private use. The value 1 is
described in this document, and all other values are currently
unspecified.

Port
: The port on the target host of the notification service. The
range is 0-65535. This is a 16 bit unsigned integer in network
byte order.

Target
: The domain name of the target host providing the service of
listening for generalized notifications of the specified type.
This name MUST resolve to one or more address records.

## Semantics

For now, the only scheme defined is scheme=1 with the interpretation
that when a new CDS (or CDNSKEY or CSYNC) is published, a NOTIFY(CDS)
or NOTIFY(CSYNC) should be sent to the address and port listed in the
corresponding NOTIFY RRset.

Other schemes are possible, but are out of scope for this document.

Example:

    parent.   IN DSYNC CDS   1 5359 cds-scanner.parent.
    parent.   IN DSYNC CSYNC 1 5360 csync-scanner.parent.

From the perspective of this protocol, the NOTIFY(CDS) packet is
simply sent to the parent's published notification address. However,
should this turn out not to be sufficient, it is possible to define a
new "scheme" that specifies alternative logic for dealing with such
requirements.  Description of internal processing in the recipient end
or for locating the recipient are out of scope of this document.

## Rationale

(RFC Editor: This subsection is to be removed before publication)

It may look like it's possible to store the same information in an SRV
record. However, this would require indicating the RRtype via a label in
the owner name, leading to name space pollution. It would also require
changing the semantics of one of the integer fields of the SRV record.

Such overloading has not been a good idea in the past. Furthermore, as
the generalized notifications are a new proposal with no prior
deployments, there is an opportunity to avoid repeating mistakes.

The DSYNC record type also provides a cleaner solution for bundling all
the new types of notification signaling in an RRset, like:

    parent.         IN DSYNC  CDS     1  59   scanner.parent.
    parent.         IN DSYNC  CSYNC   1  59   scanner.parent.

For DSYNC records indicating CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC notification targets, no
special processing needs to be applied by the authoritative nameserver
upon insertion of a DSYNC record. The nameserver can thus be "unaware".

Future use cases (such as for multi-signer key exchange) may require the
nameserver to trigger special operations, for example when a DSYNC
record is inserted during onboarding of a new signer. It seems cleaner
and easier that such processing be associated with the insertion of a
record of a new type, not an existing type like SRV.


# Delegation Maintenance: CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC Notifications

Delegation maintenance notifications address the inefficiencies related
to scanning child zones for CDS/CDNSKEY records {{!RFC7344}}. (For an
overview of the issues, see {{context}}.)

Delegation maintenance NOTIFY messages MUST be formatted as described in
{{!RFC1996}}, with the `qtype` field replaced as appropriate.

To address the CDS/CDNSKEY dichotomy, the NOTIFY(CDS) message (with
`qtype=CDS`) is defined to indicate any child-side changes pertaining
to an upcoming update of DS records. Upon receipt of NOTIFY(CDS), the
recipient (the parent registry or a registrar) SHOULD initiate the same DNS
lookups and verifications that would otherwise be triggered based on a
timer.

The CSYNC {{!RFC7477}} inefficiency may be similarly treated, with the
child sending a NOTIFY(CSYNC) message (with `qtype=CSYNC`) to an address
where the parent (or a registrar) is listening to CSYNC notifications.

In both cases the notification will speed up processing times by
providing the recipient with a hint that a particular child zone has
published new CDS, CDNSKEY and/or CSYNC records.

## Endpoint Discovery

To locate the target for outgoing delegation maintenance notifications,
the notification sender MUST perform the following procedure:

1. Construct the lookup name, by injecting the `_signal` label after the
   first label of the delegation owner name.

2. Perform a lookup of type DSYNC for the lookup name, and validate the
   response if DNSSEC is enabled. If a DSYNC RRset results, return it.

3. When the query resulted in a negative response:

   - If the negative response indicates that the parent is more than one
     label away from the `_signal` label, construct a new lookup name by
     inserting the `_signal` label into the delegation owner name just
     before the parent zone labels inferred from the negative response,
     and go to step 2.

     For example, `city.ise.mie.jp` is delegated from `jp` (and not
     from `ise.mie.jp` or `mie.jp`!). The initial DSYNC query relating
     to it is thus directed at `city._signal.ise.mie.jp`. This is
     expected to result in a negative response from `jp`, and another
     query for `city.ise.mie._signal.jp` is then required;

   - Otherwise, if the lookup name has any labels in front of the
     `_signal` label, remove them to construct a new lookup name (such
     as `_signal.jp`), and go to step 2.
     (This is to enable zone structures without wildcards.)

   - Otherwise, return null (no notification target available).

## Sending Notifications

When changing a CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC RRset in the child zone, the DNS
operator SHOULD send a suitable NOTIFY message to the endpoint located
as described in the previous section.

A NOTIFY message can only carry information about changes concerning one
child zone. When there are changes to several child zones, the sender
MUST send a separate notification for each one.

Because of the security model where a notification by itself never
causes a change (it can only speed up the time until the next
check for the same thing), the sender's identity is not crucial.
This opens up the possibility of having an arbitrary party (e.g., a
side-car service) send the notifications to the parent, thereby enabling
this functionality even before the emergence of native support in
nameserver software.

While the receiving side will often be a scanning service provided by
the registry itself, it is expected that in the ICANN RRR model, some
registries will prefer registrars to conduct CDS/CDNSKEY processing. In
such cases, the registrar notification endpoint should be published in
the parent zone, enabling the child to direct their notifications to the
appropriate target. From the perspective of the child, it is
inconsequential who's in charge of processing the notification: the
NOTIFY message is simply sent to the published address.

### Timing

When a primary name server publishes a new RRset in the child, there
will be a time delay until all publicly visible copies of the zone
will have been updated. If the primary sends a NOTIFY at the exact
time of publication of the new zone, there is a potential for the
parent to attempt CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC processing before the updated zone
is visible. In this case the parent may draw the wrong conclusion (“the
CDS RRset has not been updated”).

Having a delay between the publication of the new data and the check
for the new data would alleviate this issue. However, as the parent
has no way of knowing how quickly the child zone propagates, the
appropriate amount of delay is uncertain.

It is therefore RECOMMENDED that the child delays sending NOTIFY
messages to the recipient until a consistent public view of the pertinent
records is ensured.

### Rationale for Using the DNS Message Format

(RFC Editor: This subsection is to be removed before publication)

In the most common cases of using generalized notifications the
recipient is expected to not be a nameserver, but rather some other
type of service, like a CDS/CSYNC scanner.

However, this will likely not always be true. In particular it seems
likely that in cases where the parent is not a large
delegation-centric zone like a TLD, but rather a smaller zone with a
small number of delegations there will not be separate services for
everything and the recipient of the NOTIFY(CDS) or NOTIFY(CSYNC) will
be an authoritative nameserver for the parent zone.

For this reason it seems most reasonable to stay within the the well
documented and already supported message format specified in RFC 1996
and delivered over normal DNS transport, although not necessarily to
port 53.

## Processing of NOTIFY Messages

NOTIFY(CDS) messages carrying notification payloads (records) for
several child zones MUST be discarded, as sending them is an error.

Upon receipt of a (potentially forwarded) valid NOTIFY(CDS) message for
a particular child zone at the published address for CDS notifications,
the receiving side (parent registry or registrar) has two options:

  1. Schedule an immediate check of the CDS and CDNSKEY RRsets as
     published by that particular child zone.

     If the check finds that the CDS/CDNSKEY RRset has indeed changed,
     the parent MAY reset the scanning timer for children for which
     NOTIFY(CDS) is received, or reduce the periodic scanning frequency
     accordingly (e.g. to every two weeks).
     This will decrease the scanning effort for the parent.
     If a CDS/CDNSKEY change is then detected (without having received
     a notification), the parent SHOULD clear that state and revert to
     the default scanning schedule.

     Parents introducing CDS/CDNSKEY scanning support at the same time
     as NOTIFY(CDS) support are not in danger of breaking children's
     scanning assumption, and MAY therefore use a low-frequency
     scanning schedule in default mode.

  2. Ignore the notification, in which case the system works exactly
     as before. (One reason to do this may be a rate limit, see
     {{security}}.)

If the parent implements the first option, the convergence time (time
between publication of a new CDS/CDNSKEY record in the child and
propagation of the resulting DS) will decrease significantly, thereby
providing improved service to the child zone.

If the parent, in addition to scheduling an immediate check for the
child zone of the notification, also choses to modify the scanning
schedule (to be less frequent), the cost of providing the scanning
service will be reduced.

Upon receipt of a NOTIFY(CSYNC) to the published address for CSYNC
notifications, the same options and considerations apply as for the
NOTIFY(CDS).


# Security Considerations {#security}

The original NOTIFY specification sidesteps most security issues by not
relying on the information in the NOTIFY message in any way, and instead
only using it to "enter the state it would if the zone's refresh timer
had expired" ({{Section 4.7 of !RFC1996}}).

This security model is reused for generalized NOTIFY messages. It
therefore seems impossible to affect the behaviour of the recipient of
the NOTIFY other than by hastening the timing for when different checks
are initiated.

The receipt of a notification message will, in general, cause the
receiving party to perform one or more outbound queries for the records
of interest (for example, NOTIFY(CDS) will cause CDS/CDNSKEY
queries). When done via port 53, the size of these queries is comparable
to that of the NOTIFY messages themselves, rendering any amplification
attempts futile. The number of queries triggered per notification is
also limited by the requirement that a NOTIFY message can refer to one
child only.

However, when the outgoing query occurs via encrypted transport, some
amplification is possible, both with respect to bandwidth and
computational burden. In this case, the usual principle of bounding the
work, even under unreasonable events, applies.

Receivers therefore MUST implement rate limiting for notification
processing. It is RECOMMENDED to configure rate limiting independently
for both the notification's source IP address and the name of the zone
that is conveyed in the NOTIFY message. Rate limiting also mitigates
processing load from garbage notifications.

Alternative solutions (such as signing notifications and validating
their signatures) appear significantly more expensive without tangible
benefit.

# Efficiency and Convergence Issues in DNS Scanning {#context}

## Original NOTIFY for Zone Transfer Nudging

{{!RFC1996}} introduced the concept of a DNS Notify message which was used
to improve the convergence time for secondary servers when a DNS zone
had been updated in the primary. The basic idea was to augment the
traditional "pull" mechanism (a periodic SOA query) with a "push"
mechanism (a Notify) for a common case that was otherwise very
inefficient (due to either slow convergence or wasteful overly
frequent scanning of the primary for changes).

While it is possible to indicate how frequently checks should occur
(via the SOA Refresh parameter), these checks did not allow catching
zone changes that fall between checkpoints. {{!RFC1996}} addressed the
optimization of the time-and-cost trade-off between a seceondary checking
frequently for new versions of a zone, and infrequent checking, by
replacing scheduled scanning with the more efficient NOTIFY mechanism.

## Similar Issues for DS Maintenance and Beyond

Today, we have similar issues with slow updates of DNS data in spite of
the data having been published. The two most obvious cases are CDS and
CSYNC scanners deployed in a growing number of TLD registries. Because of
the large number of child delegations, scanning for CDS and CSYNC records
is rather slow (as in infrequent).

It is only a very small number of the delegations that will have updated
CDS or CDNSKEY record in between two scanning runs. However, frequent
scanning for CDS and CDNSKEY records is costly, and infrequent scanning
causes slower convergence (i.e., delay until the DS RRset is updated).

Unlike in the original case, where the primary is able to suggest the
scanning interval via the SOA Refresh parameter, an equivalent mechanism
does not exist for DS-related scanning.

All of this above also applies to parents that offer automated NS and glue
record maintenance via CSYNC scanning {{!RFC7477}}. Again, given that CSYNC
records change only rarely, frequent scanning of a large number of
delegations seems disproportionately costly, while infrequent scanning
causes slower convergence (delay until the delegation is updated).

While use of the NOTIFY mechanism for coordinating the key exchange in
multi-signer setups {{!I-D.wisser-dnssec-automation}} is conceivable,
the detailed specification is left for future work.
