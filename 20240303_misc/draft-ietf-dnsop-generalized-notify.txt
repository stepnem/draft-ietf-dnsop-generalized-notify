                     Generalized DNS Notifications
               draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify-latest

Abstract

   This document extends the use of DNS NOTIFY ([RFC1996] beyond
   conventional zone transfer hints, bringing the benefits of ad-hoc
   notifications to DNS delegation maintenance in general.  Use cases
   include DNSSEC key rollovers hints, and quicker changes to a
   delegation's NS record set.

   To enable this functionality, a method for discovering the receiver
   endpoint for such notification message is introduced, via the new
   NOTIFY record type.

1.  Introduction

   Traditional DNS notifications [RFC1996], which are here referred to
   as "NOTIFY(SOA)", are sent from a primary server to a secondary
   server to minimize the latter's convergence time to a new version of
   the zone.  This mechanism successfully addresses a significant
   inefficiency in the original protocol.

   Today similar inefficiencies occur in new use cases, in particular
   delegation maintenance (DS and NS record updates).  Just as in the
   NOTIFY(SOA) case, a new set of notification types will have a major
   positive benefit by allowing the DNS infrastructure to completely
   sidestep these inefficiencies.  For additional context, see
   Appendix A.

   No DNS protocol changes are introduced by this document.  The
   mechanism instead makes use of a wider range of DNS messages allowed
   by the protocol.  Future extension for further use cases (such as
   multi-signer key exchange) is possible.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with DNSSEC, including [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC6781], [RFC7344], [RFC7477], [RFC7583], and
   [RFC8901].

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",
   "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*", "*NOT
   RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only
   when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   In the text below there are two different uses of the term "NOTIFY".
   One refers to the NOTIFY message, sent from a DNSSEC signer or name
   server to a notification target (for subsequent processing).  We
   refer to this message as NOTIFY(RRtype) where the RRtype indicates
   the type of NOTIFY message (CDS or CSYNC).

   The second is a proposed new DNS record type, with the suggested
   mnemonic "NOTIFY".  This record is used to publish the location of
   the notification target.  We refer to this as the "NOTIFY record".

2.  Publication of Notification Targets

   To use generalized notifications, it is necessary for the sender to
   know where to direct each NOTIFY message.  This section describes the
   procedure for discovering that notification target.

   Note that generalized NOTIFY messages are but one mechanism for
   improving the efficiency of automated delegation maintenance.  Other
   alternatives alternatives, such as contacting the parent via an API
   or DNS Update ([RFC2136]), may (or may not) be more suitable in
   individual cases.  Like generalized notifications, they similarly
   require a means for discovering where to send the API or DNS Update
   requets.

   The scope for the publication mechanism is therefore wider than only
   to support generalized notifications, and a unified approach that
   works independently of the notification method is specified in this
   section.

2.1.  Design Requirements

   When the parent is interested in notifications for delegation
   maintenance (such as for DS or NS updates), a service will need to be
   made available for accepting these notifications.  Depending on the
   context, this service may be run by the parent zone operator
   themselves, or by a designated entity who is in charge of handling
   the domain's delegation data (such as a domain registrar).

   The simplest solution enabling straightforward discovery is for the
   parent to publish the address where it prefers to have notifications
   sent.  Potential notification senders, knowing the name of the parent
   zone, can then simply look up that information.

   It is strongly desirable that the notification sender is able to
   figure out where to send the NOTIFY via a single lookup, even when
   ignorant of the details of the parent-side business relationships
   (e.g., whether there is a registrar or not).  The mechanism should
   thus enable the parent to (optionally) announce the notification
   endpoint in a delegation-specific way.  (If the delegation is several
   labels deep, an extra query may be needed for identifying the
   parent.)

   These requirements suggest making the endpoint discoverable at a
   child-specific name.  The record there is expected to live at a
   wildcard name, unless the parent intends to publish a child-specific
   endpoint.

2.2.  Signaling Method

   Parents participating in the discovery scheme for the purpose of
   delegation maintenance notifications MUST publish endpoint
   information using the record type defined in Section 3, as described
   in this section.

   The suggested mnemonic for the new record type is "DSYNC" and it is
   further described below.

   If the parent itself performs CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC processing, or if
   the parent forwards the notifications internally to the designated
   party (such as as registrar), the following scheme is used:

   *._signal.se.   IN DSYNC  CDS   scheme port endpoint.registry.se.
   *._signal.se.   IN DSYNC  CSYNC scheme port endpoint.registry.se.

   It is also possible to publish child-specific records, where the
   wildcard label is replaced by the child's FQDN with the parent zone's
   labels stripped.

   As an example, consider a registrar offering domains like example.se,
   delegated from se zone.  If the registrar provides the notification
   endpoint, the parent may publish this information using the following
   scheme:

example._signal.se.   IN DSYNC  CDS   scheme port endpoint.registrar.com.

   (Note that this is a generic method, allowing the parent to securely
   publish other sorts of information about a child that currently is
   not easily represented in DNS, such as the registrar's identity.)

   The parent MAY synthesize records under the _signal domain.  The
   _signal domain may be delegated to another nameserver dedicated for
   this purpose.

   To accommodate indirect delegation management models (such as ICANN's
   RRR model), the parent's designated notification target may relay
   notifications to the registrar, e.g. via an EPP call, or by
   forwarding the NOTIFY(CDS) message directly.  The same is true also
   for NOTIFY(CSYNC).

3.  The DSYNC Record

3.1.  Wire Format

   The DSYNC RDATA wire format is encoded as follows:

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | RRtype                        | Scheme        | Port
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                   | Target ...  /
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-/

   RRtype  The type of generalized NOTIFY that this DSYNC RR defines the
      desired target address for.  For now, only CDS and CSYNC are
      supported values.

   Scheme  The scheme for locating the desired notification address.
      The range is 0-255.  This is an 8 bit unsigned integer.  The value
      0 is an error, and values 128-255 are reserved for private use.
      The value 1 is described in this document, and all other values
      are currently unspecified.

   Port  The port on the target host of the notification service.  The
      range is 0-65535.  This is a 16 bit unsigned integer in network
      byte order.

   Target  The domain name of the target host providing the service of
      listening for generalized notifications of the specified type.
      This name MUST resolve to one or more address records.

3.2.  Semantics

   For now, the only scheme defined is scheme=1 with the interpretation
   that when a new CDS (or CDNSKEY or CSYNC) is published, a NOTIFY(CDS)
   or NOTIFY(CSYNC) should be sent to the address and port listed in the
   corresponding NOTIFY RRset.

   Other schemes are possible, but are out of scope for this document.

   Example:

   parent.   IN DSYNC CDS   1 5359 cds-scanner.parent.
   parent.   IN DSYNC CSYNC 1 5360 csync-scanner.parent.

   From the perspective of this protocol, the NOTIFY(CDS) packet is
   simply sent to the parent's published notification address.  However,
   should this turn out not to be sufficient, it is possible to define a
   new "scheme" that specifies alternative logic for dealing with such
   requirements.  Description of internal processing in the recipient
   end or for locating the recipient are out of scope of this document.

3.3.  Rationale

   (RFC Editor: This subsection is to be removed before publication)

   It may look like it's possible to store the same information in an
   SRV record.  However, this would require indicating the RRtype via a
   label in the owner name, leading to name space pollution.  It would
   also require changing the semantics of one of the integer fields of
   the SRV record.

   Such overloading has not been a good idea in the past.  Furthermore,
   as the generalized notifications are a new proposal with no prior
   deployments, there is an opportunity to avoid repeating mistakes.

   The DSYNC record type also provides a cleaner solution for bundling
   all the new types of notification signaling in an RRset, like:

   parent.         IN DSYNC  CDS     1  59   scanner.parent.
   parent.         IN DSYNC  CSYNC   1  59   scanner.parent.

   For DSYNC records indicating CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC notification targets,
   no special processing needs to be applied by the authoritative
   nameserver upon insertion of a DSYNC record.  The nameserver can thus
   be "unaware".

   Future use cases (such as for multi-signer key exchange) may require
   the nameserver to trigger special operations, for example when a
   DSYNC record is inserted during onboarding of a new signer.  It seems
   cleaner and easier that such processing be associated with the
   insertion of a record of a new type, not an existing type like SRV.

4.  Delegation Maintenance: CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC Notifications

   Delegation maintenance notifications address the inefficiencies
   related to scanning child zones for CDS/CDNSKEY records [RFC7344].
   (For an overview of the issues, see Appendix A.)

   Delegation maintenance NOTIFY messages MUST be formatted as described
   in [RFC1996], with the qtype field replaced as appropriate.

   To address the CDS/CDNSKEY dichotomy, the NOTIFY(CDS) message (with
   qtype=CDS) is defined to indicate any child-side changes pertaining
   to an upcoming update of DS records.  Upon receipt of NOTIFY(CDS),
   the recipient (the parent registry or a registrar) SHOULD initiate
   the same DNS lookups and verifications that would otherwise be
   triggered based on a timer.

   The CSYNC [RFC7477] inefficiency may be similarly treated, with the
   child sending a NOTIFY(CSYNC) message (with qtype=CSYNC) to an
   address where the parent (or a registrar) is listening to CSYNC
   notifications.

   In both cases the notification will speed up processing times by
   providing the recipient with a hint that a particular child zone has
   published new CDS, CDNSKEY and/or CSYNC records.

4.1.  Endpoint Discovery

   To locate the target for outgoing delegation maintenance
   notifications, the notification sender MUST perform the following
   procedure:

   1.  Construct the lookup name, by injecting the _signal label after
       the first label of the delegation owner name.

   2.  Perform a lookup of type DSYNC for the lookup name, and validate
       the response if DNSSEC is enabled.  If a DSYNC RRset results,
       return it.

   3.  When the query resulted in a negative response:

       *  If the negative response indicates that the parent is more
          than one label away from the _signal label, construct a new
          lookup name by inserting the _signal label into the delegation
          owner name just before the parent zone labels inferred from
          the negative response, and go to step 2.

          For example, city.ise.mie.jp is delegated from jp (and not
          from ise.mie.jp or mie.jp!).  The initial DSYNC query relating
          to it is thus directed at city._signal.ise.mie.jp.  This is
          expected to result in a negative response from jp, and another
          query for city.ise.mie._signal.jp is then required;

       *  Otherwise, if the lookup name has any labels in front of the
          _signal label, remove them to construct a new lookup name
          (such as _signal.jp), and go to step 2.  (This is to enable
          zone structures without wildcards.)

       *  Otherwise, return null (no notification target available).

4.2.  Sending Notifications

   When changing a CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC RRset in the child zone, the DNS
   operator SHOULD send a suitable NOTIFY message to the endpoint
   located as described in the previous section.

   A NOTIFY message can only carry information about changes concerning
   one child zone.  When there are changes to several child zones, the
   sender MUST send a separate notification for each one.

   Because of the security model where a notification by itself never
   causes a change (it can only speed up the time until the next check
   for the same thing), the sender's identity is not crucial.  This
   opens up the possibility of having an arbitrary party (e.g., a side-
   car service) send the notifications to the parent, thereby enabling
   this functionality even before the emergence of native support in
   nameserver software.

   While the receiving side will often be a scanning service provided by
   the registry itself, it is expected that in the ICANN RRR model, some
   registries will prefer registrars to conduct CDS/CDNSKEY processing.
   In such cases, the registrar notification endpoint should be
   published in the parent zone, enabling the child to direct their
   notifications to the appropriate target.  From the perspective of the
   child, it is inconsequential who's in charge of processing the
   notification: the NOTIFY message is simply sent to the published
   address.

4.2.1.  Timing

   When a primary name server publishes a new RRset in the child, there
   will be a time delay until all publicly visible copies of the zone
   will have been updated.  If the primary sends a NOTIFY at the exact
   time of publication of the new zone, there is a potential for the
   parent to attempt CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC processing before the updated
   zone is visible.  In this case the parent may draw the wrong
   conclusion (“the CDS RRset has not been updated”).

   Having a delay between the publication of the new data and the check
   for the new data would alleviate this issue.  However, as the parent
   has no way of knowing how quickly the child zone propagates, the
   appropriate amount of delay is uncertain.

   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that the child delays sending NOTIFY
   messages to the recipient until a consistent public view of the
   pertinent records is ensured.

4.2.2.  Rationale for Using the DNS Message Format

   (RFC Editor: This subsection is to be removed before publication)

   In the most common cases of using generalized notifications the
   recipient is expected to not be a nameserver, but rather some other
   type of service, like a CDS/CSYNC scanner.

   However, this will likely not always be true.  In particular it seems
   likely that in cases where the parent is not a large delegation-
   centric zone like a TLD, but rather a smaller zone with a small
   number of delegations there will not be separate services for
   everything and the recipient of the NOTIFY(CDS) or NOTIFY(CSYNC) will
   be an authoritative nameserver for the parent zone.

   For this reason it seems most reasonable to stay within the the well
   documented and already supported message format specified in RFC 1996
   and delivered over normal DNS transport, although not necessarily to
   port 53.

4.3.  Processing of NOTIFY Messages

   NOTIFY(CDS) messages carrying notification payloads (records) for
   several child zones MUST be discarded, as sending them is an error.

   Upon receipt of a (potentially forwarded) valid NOTIFY(CDS) message
   for a particular child zone at the published address for CDS
   notifications, the receiving side (parent registry or registrar) has
   two options:

   1.  Schedule an immediate check of the CDS and CDNSKEY RRsets as
       published by that particular child zone.

       If the check finds that the CDS/CDNSKEY RRset has indeed changed,
       the parent MAY reset the scanning timer for children for which
       NOTIFY(CDS) is received, or reduce the periodic scanning
       frequency accordingly (e.g. to every two weeks).  This will
       decrease the scanning effort for the parent.  If a CDS/CDNSKEY
       change is then detected (without having received a notification),
       the parent SHOULD clear that state and revert to the default
       scanning schedule.

       Parents introducing CDS/CDNSKEY scanning support at the same time
       as NOTIFY(CDS) support are not in danger of breaking children's
       scanning assumption, and MAY therefore use a low-frequency
       scanning schedule in default mode.

   2.  Ignore the notification, in which case the system works exactly
       as before.  (One reason to do this may be a rate limit, see
       Section 5.)

   If the parent implements the first option, the convergence time (time
   between publication of a new CDS/CDNSKEY record in the child and
   propagation of the resulting DS) will decrease significantly, thereby
   providing improved service to the child zone.

   If the parent, in addition to scheduling an immediate check for the
   child zone of the notification, also choses to modify the scanning
   schedule (to be less frequent), the cost of providing the scanning
   service will be reduced.

   Upon receipt of a NOTIFY(CSYNC) to the published address for CSYNC
   notifications, the same options and considerations apply as for the
   NOTIFY(CDS).

5.  Security Considerations

   The original NOTIFY specification sidesteps most security issues by
   not relying on the information in the NOTIFY message in any way, and
   instead only using it to "enter the state it would if the zone's
   refresh timer had expired" (Section 4.7 of [RFC1996]).

   This security model is reused for generalized NOTIFY messages.  It
   therefore seems impossible to affect the behaviour of the recipient
   of the NOTIFY other than by hastening the timing for when different
   checks are initiated.

   The receipt of a notification message will, in general, cause the
   receiving party to perform one or more outbound queries for the
   records of interest (for example, NOTIFY(CDS) will cause CDS/CDNSKEY
   queries).  When done via port 53, the size of these queries is
   comparable to that of the NOTIFY messages themselves, rendering any
   amplification attempts futile.  The number of queries triggered per
   notification is also limited by the requirement that a NOTIFY message
   can refer to one child only.

   However, when the outgoing query occurs via encrypted transport, some
   amplification is possible, both with respect to bandwidth and
   computational burden.  In this case, the usual principle of bounding
   the work, even under unreasonable events, applies.

   Receivers therefore MUST implement rate limiting for notification
   processing.  It is RECOMMENDED to configure rate limiting
   independently for both the notification's source IP address and the
   name of the zone that is conveyed in the NOTIFY message.  Rate
   limiting also mitigates processing load from garbage notifications.

   Alternative solutions (such as signing notifications and validating
   their signatures) appear significantly more expensive without
   tangible benefit.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Per [RFC8552], IANA is requested to create a new registry on the
   "Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters" IANA web page as follows:

Appendix A.  Efficiency and Convergence Issues in DNS Scanning

A.1.  Original NOTIFY for Zone Transfer Nudging

   [RFC1996] introduced the concept of a DNS Notify message which was
   used to improve the convergence time for secondary servers when a DNS
   zone had been updated in the primary.  The basic idea was to augment
   the traditional "pull" mechanism (a periodic SOA query) with a "push"
   mechanism (a Notify) for a common case that was otherwise very
   inefficient (due to either slow convergence or wasteful overly
   frequent scanning of the primary for changes).

   While it is possible to indicate how frequently checks should occur
   (via the SOA Refresh parameter), these checks did not allow catching
   zone changes that fall between checkpoints.  [RFC1996] addressed the
   optimization of the time-and-cost trade-off between a seceondary
   checking frequently for new versions of a zone, and infrequent
   checking, by replacing scheduled scanning with the more efficient
   NOTIFY mechanism.

A.2.  Similar Issues for DS Maintenance and Beyond

   Today, we have similar issues with slow updates of DNS data in spite
   of the data having been published.  The two most obvious cases are
   CDS and CSYNC scanners deployed in a growing number of TLD
   registries.  Because of the large number of child delegations,
   scanning for CDS and CSYNC records is rather slow (as in infrequent).

   It is only a very small number of the delegations that will have
   updated CDS or CDNSKEY record in between two scanning runs.  However,
   frequent scanning for CDS and CDNSKEY records is costly, and
   infrequent scanning causes slower convergence (i.e., delay until the
   DS RRset is updated).

   Unlike in the original case, where the primary is able to suggest the
   scanning interval via the SOA Refresh parameter, an equivalent
   mechanism does not exist for DS-related scanning.

   All of this above also applies to parents that offer automated NS and
   glue record maintenance via CSYNC scanning [RFC7477].  Again, given
   that CSYNC records change only rarely, frequent scanning of a large
   number of delegations seems disproportionately costly, while
   infrequent scanning causes slower convergence (delay until the
   delegation is updated).

   While use of the NOTIFY mechanism for coordinating the key exchange
   in multi-signer setups [I-D.wisser-dnssec-automation] is conceivable,
   the detailed specification is left for future work.
